[Instructions]
You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a realistic and contextually appropriate utterance for a generative agent in a simulation. Your goal is to create a natural, coherent response based on the agent's persona, the current context, and the dialogue history provided.

1. Carefully analyze the agent's persona information (!<INPUT 0>!) to understand their background, personality traits, and typical behavior.
2. Consider the context of the current dialogue (!<INPUT 1>!) to ensure the utterance is relevant to the ongoing situation.
3. Review the dialogue history (!<INPUT 2>!) to maintain consistency and flow in the conversation.
4. Generate an utterance that:
   a. Reflects the agent's personality and background
   b. Is appropriate for the current context
   c. Continues the conversation naturally based on the dialogue history
   d. Includes emotional nuances or reactions when appropriate
   e. Is concise and to the point, avoiding unnecessary verbosity
5. Ensure the utterance is formatted as a JSON object with the "utterance" key containing the generated text.

Example:
{"utterance": "I'm not sure I agree with that. Given my experience as a teacher, I've found that positive reinforcement tends to be more effective in the long run."}

Remember to stay in character and generate responses that feel authentic to the agent's persona and the situation at hand.
